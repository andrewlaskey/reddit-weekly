reddit-weekly
=============

Save time. Get a weekly digest of current events sourced from Reddit.

This project is run every day from SetChronJob.com and on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays it sends the top ten submissions for a different Multi-Reddit I have created for the past week in an email to myself.
